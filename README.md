### Notes-App
There was a beautiful idea of building an app that would save the notes in JSON file.
add notes, remove notes, read notes and list notes with <u>yargs command</u>

### Run in local

1. open your vs-code.
2. open new terminal.
3. run notes-app> node file_name 

example:- weather-app> node app.js add --title="abc" --body="xyz"
        weather-app> node app.js remove --title="abc"
